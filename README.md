## Building from Source üî®

**Create EXE with PyInstaller**:
```
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --console --icon "icon.ico" --name flasher flash.py
```

**Build Automation (GitHub Actions)**:
```
# .github/workflows/build.yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [windows-latest, ubuntu-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
      - run: pip install -r requirements.txt
      - run: pyinstaller --onefile --name flasher flash.py
```

## Device Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è

**`devices.json` Structure**:
```json
{
    "devices": [
      {
        "model": "Nothing Phone 2",
        "codename": "pong",
        "board": "taro",
        "partitions": {
          "boot": ["boot", "vendor_boot", "dtbo", "recovery"],
          "firmware": ["abl", "aop", "aop_config", "bluetooth", "cpucp", "devcfg", "dsp", "featenabler", "hyp", "imagefv", "keymaster", "modem", "multiimgoem", "multiimgqti", "qupfw", "qweslicstore", "shrm", "tz", "uefi", "uefisecapp", "xbl", "xbl_config", "xbl_ramdump"],
          "logical": ["system", "system_ext", "product", "vendor", "vendor_dlkm", "odm"],
          "vbmeta": ["vbmeta_system", "vbmeta_vendor"]
        },
        "slot_specific": ["boot", "vendor_boot", "dtbo", "recovery"]
      }
   ]
}
```
### How to find "board" variable
- **When in bootloader run the following command**
```bash
fastboot getvar product
```
- **Alternatively use the following command**
```bash
getprop | grep -i board
```
- **Copy the value for `ro.product.board`:**

## Flashing Instructions üóíÔ∏è

- Download the correct flasher executable for your OS (Windows/Linux) from the releases page before proceeding.
- Place the script in the same directory where the all the required stock partition `.img` files are located.
   - For **Nothing** and **CMF** phones, you can obtain these files from the [nothing_archive](https://github.com/spike0en/nothing_archive).
   - Alternatively, you can extract the `.img` files from a `payload.bin` file if it's available for your specific device model.
- Ensure your device is in **bootloader mode** before proceeding.
- **For Windows:**
   - Double-click the `flasher.exe` file to start the process.
- **For Linux/macOS:**
   - Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `.img` files are located.
   - Run the following commands to set execution permissions and flash the files:     
  ```bash
  # Make the binary executable
  chmod +x flasher
  # Execute the flasher
  ./flasher
  ```
  
## Troubleshooting üîß

**Common Issues**:
- **Missing .img Files**: Ensure required partitions exist in working directory
- **Admin Rights**: On Windows, run as Administrator for system PATH updates
- **Device Not Detected**:
  - Verify fastboot mode
  - Check USB drivers.
  - For windows: Ensure that the `Android Bootloader Interface` appears in Device Manager when the device is connected in bootloader mode.
  - For Linux: Configure udev rules
- **Board Mismatch**: Double-check device configuration in `devices.json`

**Log Analysis**:
```bash
# Check generated log files
tail -f flash_log_20250209_1600.txt
```
